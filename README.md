# 🎓 Student Feedback Analysis using NLP

## 📌 Project Overview

College events such as tech fests, workshops, seminars, and cultural programs collect valuable student feedback through surveys. However, this feedback is often underutilized.

This project analyzes **rating-based and textual feedback** collected via Google Forms to understand **student satisfaction, sentiment, and areas of improvement** using **data analytics and Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques.

The goal is to convert raw feedback data into **meaningful insights** that can help event organizers make data-driven decisions.
